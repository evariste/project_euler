#   The n^(th) term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,
#   t_(n) = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

#   1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

#   By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to
#   its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word
#   value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 =
#   t_(10). If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call
#   the word a triangle word.

#   Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K
#   text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how
#   many are triangle words?

# A: 162
